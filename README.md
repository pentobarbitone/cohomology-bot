A Discord bot that blends algebraic topology with fun and interactive commands.

Cohomology Bot is a Python-powered Discord bot that performs simple algebraic-topology computations, including simplicial complexes, Betti numbers, and Euler characteristics. It also sends fun cohomology-themed “vibes” and server-friendly messages.

This project showcases:

Discord API / bot development

Python (discord.py)

Graph theory + algebraic topology

Command parsing

Clean environment / token handling
